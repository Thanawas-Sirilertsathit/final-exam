I created the Polygon class which has initial atttributes are random sizes,
random location x and y, random orientation, random border size and the actual number of sides.

This Polygon class still has two more methods which are use in different situations.
First one the draw_polygon method. this one uses to generate each polygon seperately.
Second one the draw_triple_polygon method. this one uses to generate 3 polygons in different size
and inside the biggest one.

There is one outside function. get_new_color function.
This one uses to generate random color to input into those two methods of Polygon class.

There is one input called art to generate 1-8 arts.

1. art 1 is 30 triangles randomly
2. art 2 is 30 squares randomly
3. art 3 is 30 pentagons randomly
4. art 4 is 30 random polygons randomly
5. art 5 is 10 of triple triangles randomly
6. art 6 is 10 of triple squares randomly
7. art 7 is 10 of triple pentagons randomly
8. art 8 is 10 of triple polygons randomly
